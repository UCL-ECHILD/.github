# UCL-ECHILD

We are the UCL ECHILD team.

The [ECHILD project](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/research/population-policy-and-practice-research-and-teaching-department/cenb-clinical-20) 
is a research study run by 
[University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/research/population-policy-and-practice-research-and-teaching-department/cenb) 
that joins together existing health, education and social care information for all children in England for the first time.

We are using this linked data to better understand how education affects children’s health, and how health affects children’s education.
 
To start, we will use the data to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown affected children who need extra support. We will also look 
at the quality of the linked data to find out its strengths and limitations for research.
