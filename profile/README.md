# ECHILD

The [ECHILD research database](https://www.echild.ac.uk) 
joins together existing health, education and social care information for all children in England for the first time.

The ECHILD project team is led by [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/echild) in collaboration with the 
[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) 
and the [Institute for Fiscal Studies](https://www.ifs.org.uk/), 
in partnership with the 
[Department of Health and Social Care](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care) 
and the 
[Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education), 
working with 
[NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/)
and the 
[Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).
