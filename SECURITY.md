## Security & Data Protection

The UCL-ECHILD project team takes data security and research integrity seriously, this include all of the repositories hosted under the 
[UCL-ECHILD](https://github.com/UCL-ECHILD) and [ECHILD Analyses](https://github.com/ECHILD-analyses) GitHub Organisation.

**⚠️: All ECHILD users are reminded that only outputs cleared by the ONS SRS Statistical Support team may be used outside of the secure 
environment in which the ECHILD research database is hosted.**

## Reporting Security or Data Protection Issues 

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability or data protection breach in any UCL-ECHILD or ECHILD-analyses hosted repository, 
please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report suspected security vulnerabilities or data protection breaches through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to ich.echild[@]ucl.ac.uk with the subject line "ECHILD GitHub SDP Issue".

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., data protection breach, security vulnerability)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code/documentation (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any further details you consider relevant

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
